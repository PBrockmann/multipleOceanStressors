This a web application designed to distribute derivated products described in http://www.biogeosciences.net/10/6225/2013/

This application is structured by using Flask, a python framework, and served by Gunicorn, a python WSGI HTTP server.

The tiles displayed on maps are generated by using pyferret for the rendering.
Please visit https://github.com/PBrockmann/wms-pyferret for more information on this code 
where only a gunicorn server is used.

The use of Flask framework with the Gunicorn server was investigated here https://github.com/KatiRG/wms-pyferret
